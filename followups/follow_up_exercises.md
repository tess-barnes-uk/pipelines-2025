# Follow up Exercises

## Tasks

1. Explain how code on your delivery is packaged and deployed.
2. Explain what you understand of the approach to hosting apps in the course.
3. How does this differ from approaches you've used before? What's the impact of changing our mind? and the benefits?
4. Explain the troubleshooting steps you would use on a failing pipeline, either those you learned on this course or those you have used on your delivery.
5. Identify a problem or improvement you could do on a pipeline on your delivery. What did your team decide to do to fix or improve it (even if it hasn't been prioritised yet)?

## Stretch task
1. Terraform resources to build docker images and push them to ECR is not the only way, it's not even the most usual way using github actions! Try out a new pipeline with different github actions to build and deploy the ex 6 image to the ex 6 ECR. You could start from your ex 3 pipeline syntax to build and test the node code first.
2. If you identified a different approach to hosting apps containers, investigate more and explain your discovered new approach including, what are the pros and cons of adopting it, if our start point is where the course examples left off?
