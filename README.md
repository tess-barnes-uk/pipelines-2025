# pipelines-2025
Workshop on pipelines touching on docker, github actions, terraform, aws, troubleshooting and dependency checking.

## Course structure
Each exercise has a summary sheet and a notes section to record any answers (or questions) you have.

The exercises build on eachother in sequence, so to get the best out of them, resist the urge to seek out spoilers as much as you can!

## Use of node
Following concerns about npm package repository attacks, the exercises in this project assume [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-homebrew) rather than npm in the node app spaces. This means that you will see a pnpm-lock.yaml file rather than a package-lock.json file in this repo for each node app directory.

## Notes for apprentices

This course is assessed individually. The assessment criteria and how this course matches up with your apprenticeship will be provided separately.

The tasks for each exercise are for *during the* session. The stretch tasks can be completed *outside* the session for additional credit. 

On using the Notes section for each exercise: Thinking aloud here will help you contribute to your overall assessment.

There are additional exercises in the [followups](./followups/) folder to complete once you are back on delivery and should be completed by the given submission date for assessment.

Additional hints and resources are provided in the [docs](./docs/) folder.
